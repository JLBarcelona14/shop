Hi sir Aaron,

Here are the sql query base on the following scenrio.

I also create a actual database named "sandwich_shop.sql" so you can test the query is working.

Task #3:
Using the ER diagram you created above, write SQL queries to help Tom and the managers see:
1. How many orders there were per store per day.
	SELECT b.store_name,DATE(a.order_date) as date,count(a.order_id) as order_per_day FROM orders a LEFT JOIN shop b on a.shop_id = b.shop_id  GROUP BY b.shop_id, DATE(a.order_date);

2.What the most popular sandwich is at each store between the hours of 12:00 and 14:00.

	SELECT b.store_name,d.product_name,DATE(a.order_date) as date,a.order_time as time,max(c.qty) as order_per_day FROM orders a 
	LEFT JOIN shop b on a.shop_id = b.shop_id 
	INNER JOIN order_detail c on a.order_id = c.order_id
	INNER JOIN product d on c.product_id = d.product_id
	INNER JOIN product_category e on d.category_id = e.category_id
	WHERE HOUR(a.order_time) between HOUR('12:00:00') AND HOUR('14:00:00') and e.category_name = 'Sandwich' 
	GROUP BY b.shop_id, DATE(a.order_date)
	ORDER BY max(c.qty) desc;

3.Which employee has made the most sales (in dollars) in the last 30 days.

	SELECT a.store_name,concat(c.firstname,' ',c.lastname) as employee_name, sum(b.total_payment) sales from shop a
	INNER JOIN orders b on a.shop_id = b.shop_id
	INNER JOIN employee c on b.employee_id = c.employee_id
	WHERE date(b.order_date) BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY AND NOW()
	GROUP BY b.shop_id, b.employee_id
	ORDER BY sum(b.total_payment) desc;


4.Which drink is the most popular choice to go with the “Lake Erie Submarine”

	SELECT b.store_name,d.product_name,DATE(a.order_date) as date,a.order_time as time,max(c.qty) as order_per_day FROM orders a 
	LEFT JOIN shop b on a.shop_id = b.shop_id 
	INNER JOIN order_detail c on a.order_id = c.order_id
	INNER JOIN product d on c.product_id = d.product_id
	INNER JOIN product_category e on d.category_id = e.category_id
	WHERE a.shop_id = 3 and e.category_name = 'Drinks' 
	ORDER BY max(c.qty) desc;
